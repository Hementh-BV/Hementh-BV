Iâ€™m currently learning about multiple technologies with integration to one another. I've been currently learning and working on:

All the practicals related to these are being done on RHEL8. Apart from these I'm also learning ML and done projects on Hadoop. To know about my projects and tasks in detail please visit my linkedin profile: profile-link
